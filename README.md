# N-Body simulation

This is the final version of the nbody simulation I made in my first year at my university.

A light write up of my group, including the unity version, can be found [here](https://www.mintgruen.tu-berlin.de/mathesisWiki/doku.php?id=ws2122:nbody:n-body-simulation).

At the end, the simulation implemented the following features:
- 100% python source code
- via `numba.cude` implemented gpu accelerated calculations 
-
